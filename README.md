This app allows profile analytics to be tracked, recorded, and sent to segment, which in turn sends well timed advertisements via text and email, as well as change featured products on screen based on viewed categories of posts. The user will also get messages when they abandon their cart for an hour and when they spend more than $300. Users can also contact support through flex. 

The analytics panel shows all events being sent to segment, which are stored in local storage through a middlewear for the analytics api.
